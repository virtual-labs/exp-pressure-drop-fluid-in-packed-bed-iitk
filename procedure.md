1.	Close all the valves.
2.	Fill sump tank Â¾ with clean water and ensure that no foreign particles are there. 
3.	Open by-pass valve.
4.	Ensure that ON/OFF switch given on the panel is at OFF position.
5.	Switch on the main power supply and then switch ON the pump.
6.	Open flow control valve and allow water to flow through test section by partially closing valve.
7.	Open the air release valve provided on the manometer, slowly to release the air from manometer.
8.	When there is no air in the manometer, close air release valve.
9.	Set the position of pitot tube at the centre of the test section by adjusting the pointer to zero by knob provided.
10.	Adjust water flow rate with the help of control valve and by pass valve.
11.	Record the manometer reading.
12.	Measure the flow of water, discharged, using stop watch and measuring tank.
13.	Repeat the experiment for different flow rates of water by operating control valve and by-pass valve.
14.	Record the manometer reading for different position of pitot tube at particular discharge for determination of velocity profile.
